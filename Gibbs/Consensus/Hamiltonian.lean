/-! # Consensus Hamiltonian decomposition

The effective Hamiltonian for consensus decomposes into three physical terms:

- `H_conflict` penalizes conflicting decisions (the "anti-ferromagnetic"
  energy that consensus must overcome).
- `H_delay` penalizes prolonged indecision, driving the system toward a
  decided state (analogous to an external field that breaks symmetry).
- `H_fault` encodes adversarial or crash behavior, raising the energy of
  executions where faulty processes disrupt communication.

Safety invariants correspond to *forbidden regions* of execution space where
the total energy is `+∞`. These regions have zero Boltzmann weight and are
automatically excluded from partition-function sums, ensuring that no
thermodynamic average ever crosses a safety boundary.
