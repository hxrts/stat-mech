/-! # Safety and liveness monotonicity

Safety and liveness have opposite monotonicity in the execution set, which
is why randomness helps liveness but cannot help safety.

Safety is a universal property: "for all executions in `Ω`, no bad macrostate
is realized." Enlarging `Ω` (adding more possible executions) can only break
safety, never establish it. Safety is monotone *downward* under set inclusion.

Liveness is an existential property: "some execution in `Ω` realizes a good
macrostate." Enlarging `Ω` can only help liveness. Liveness is monotone
*upward* under set inclusion.

This asymmetry is why BFT protocols separate the two concerns: quorum
structure (which restricts `Ω`) enforces safety, while randomness (which
enriches `Ω`) enables liveness.
