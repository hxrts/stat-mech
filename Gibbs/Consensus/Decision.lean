/-! # Decisions and macrostates

A *decision macrostate* is the coarse-grained observable of consensus. It is the
vector of values that honest processes have decided on (or `none` if undecided).
This is the order-parameter-level description. Many different microscopic
executions can produce the same macrostate, and the physics of consensus is about
which macrostates dominate the partition function.

Agreement means all decided values coincide (ordered phase). Disagreement means
at least two differ (disordered phase).
