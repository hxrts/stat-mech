/-! # Adversary model

An adversary is a bounded perturbation of the execution. It can apply any
transformation from its `allowed` set, subject to a corruption `budget` that
limits how many processes or messages it may alter. The *adversary ball*
`B_A(ω)` around an execution `ω` is the set of all executions the adversary
can steer the system into, the analogue of a noise ball in coding theory.

Safety reduces to showing that no execution in the adversary ball crosses into
a bad macrostate. The adversary ball must stay inside the basin of attraction
of the correct ordered phase.
