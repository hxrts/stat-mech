/-! # Error-correcting codes as non-interactive consensus

An ECC is the degenerate case of interactive consensus: a single sender, one
round of communication (`T = 1`), and a memoryless channel. The "execution" is
just the received word, and the interactive distance between codewords reduces
to ordinary Hamming distance. Unique decoding within radius `t` corresponds to
the safety gap condition `Δ > f` with `f = t`.

This bridge makes the coding theory / consensus unification structural rather
than just an analogy. Any theorem about interactive distance specializes to a
theorem about code distance when the interaction is trivial.
