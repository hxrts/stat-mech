/-! # Universality classes of consensus protocols

Protocols fall into universality classes determined by macroscopic gap behavior,
not by their microscopic message-passing details.

- **Class I (gapless/critical):** No energy gap between agreement and
  disagreement. Competing histories coexist and reorganizations are always
  possible. Nakamoto consensus lives here.
- **Class II (gapped/ordered):** Positive energy gap creates a barrier between
  phases. Once decided, alternative histories are thermodynamically forbidden.
  BFT protocols with quorum intersection live here.
- **Class III (hybrid):** Probabilistic finality with exponential suppression
  but no hard gap. Fast probabilistic agreement with BFT fallback.

The *thermodynamic gap* is the `liminf` of the normalized interactive distance
`(1/N) min Δ_H(Good, Bad)` as `N → ∞`. A positive thermodynamic gap at
corruption fraction `α < 1/3` characterizes the gapped (BFT) phase.
