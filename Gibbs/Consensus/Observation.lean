/-! # Observations and indistinguishability

Each process observes only a local projection of the global execution, called
its "view". Two executions are *indistinguishable* to an honest set `H` when every
process in `H` sees exactly the same local history. This is the information-
theoretic core of consensus impossibility: an adversary that can produce two
executions indistinguishable to `H` forces honest processes into identical
behavior on both, even if the executions lead to different "correct" outcomes.
