/-! # Linearized Stability for Mean-Field ODEs

If all eigenvalues of the Jacobian at a fixed point have negative real part
(the Hurwitz condition), the fixed point is asymptotically stable. The proof
follows the Lyapunov approach: the Hurwitz condition implies existence of a
strict Lyapunov function (a positive-definite quadratic form that decreases
along trajectories), which in turn implies asymptotic stability.

    **Proof strategy**: Given ε > 0, use compactness of the sphere
    ‖y − x‖ = ε to find the minimum m of V on it (m > 0). By continuity
    of V at x with V(x) = 0, find δ with V(y) < m for ‖y − x‖ < δ.
    V decreasing along trajectories keeps V(sol t) < m, forcing
    ‖sol t − x‖ < ε. -/

/-! ## Nonlinear Approximation -/

/-- Near a fixed point, the drift is well-approximated by the Jacobian.
    F(x* + δ) = A·δ + R(δ) where ‖R(δ)‖ ≤ ε·‖δ‖ for small δ.

    This follows from the definition of the Fréchet derivative:
    F is differentiable at x* means F(x) = F(x*) + (fderiv F x*)(x - x*) + o(‖x - x*‖).
    Since F(x*) = 0 (fixed point), we get the linearization. -/

/-! ## Main Theorem -/

/-- Linearized stability implies asymptotic stability via Lyapunov functions.

    **Proof**: IsLinearlyStable gives a fixed point with Hurwitz Jacobian.
    `hurwitz_implies_lyapunov_exists` constructs a strict Lyapunov function
    (explicit Lyapunov hypothesis). `strict_lyapunov_implies_asymptotic` then
    gives asymptotic stability. -/
