/-! # Population Transition Rules

Microscopic dynamics are specified by transition rules, each with a
stoichiometric update (which states gain or lose agents) and a rate function
(how fast the transition fires, depending on the current distribution). The
macroscopic drift is the sum over all rules: F(x)_q = sum_r update_r(q) *
rate_r(x). This is the standard generator for density-dependent continuous-time
Markov chains.

This file defines `PopRule`, the specialized `BinaryRule` for pairwise
interactions, derives `driftFromRules`, and proves the resulting drift conserves
probability.
