# Mean-Field Dynamics

Many systems in Stat Mech reduce to populations of agents in a finite number of states. Molecules in a chemical reaction network switch between species. Spins in an Ising model flip between up and down. Nodes in a consensus protocol vote for different values. In each case, the macroscopic behavior depends not on individual agents but on the fraction of the population in each state.

This chapter formalizes how those fractions evolve over time. The state of a population lives on the probability simplex, the set of all valid distributions over a finite state space. Drift functions describe how the distribution changes. Rules (reaction rates, flip rates, vote-switching rates) compose into drift functions. The key results are that solutions always exist, always stay on the simplex, and converge to equilibrium under appropriate conditions.

The stability theory here connects back to convex duality (Chapter 3): the Bregman divergence to equilibrium serves as a Lyapunov function, providing a formal proof that the system converges. The Ising model serves as the concrete example that ties the module together, exhibiting a phase transition between disordered and ordered states that reappears in the consensus setting (Chapter 8).

## The Probability Simplex

The probability simplex over a finite state space $Q$ is the set of nonneg vectors that sum to one:

$$\text{Simplex}(Q) = \{ x : Q \to \mathbb{R} \mid x_q \geq 0 \text{ for all } q, \; \sum_q x_q = 1 \}$$

A `PopulationState Q` stores integer counts with a positive total. The `empirical` function normalizes these counts into a point on the simplex. The theorems `empirical_nonneg` and `empirical_sum_one` verify the normalization.

The simplex is compact (closed and bounded in finite dimensions). This compactness is essential for ODE existence: it prevents finite-time blowup and guarantees that bounded drifts produce globally defined solutions.

## Drift Functions and Rules

The drift function specifies how the distribution changes at each instant. A `DriftFunction Q` maps a state $x : Q \to \mathbb{R}$ to a velocity $F(x) : Q \to \mathbb{R}$. Two constraints ensure the simplex is forward-invariant:

1. Conservation: $\sum_q F(x)_q = 0$ for all $x$ on the simplex.
2. Boundary: $F(x)_q \geq 0$ whenever $x_q = 0$.

Conservation keeps the total probability at one. The boundary condition prevents components from going negative. Together they guarantee that trajectories starting in the simplex remain there.

Drift functions are built compositionally from `PopRule` structures. Each rule specifies a stoichiometric update vector and a rate function. The `driftFromRules` function aggregates a list of rules by summing their contributions. Conservation and boundary invariance are proved by induction on the rule list in `driftFromRules_conserves` and `driftFromRules_boundary_nonneg`.

## ODE Existence and Uniqueness

Before analyzing where solutions go, we need to know they exist. The drift function is Lipschitz on the simplex by construction, but Mathlib's Picard-Lindelof theorem requires a globally Lipschitz function. The `LipschitzBridge.lean` module extends the drift from the simplex to all of $\mathbb{R}^Q$ while preserving the Lipschitz constant. The theorem `extend_lipschitz` establishes this.

Local existence follows from Picard-Lindelöf on a bounded ball containing the simplex. The `local_ode_exists` theorem in `Existence.lean` constructs the `IsPicardLindelof` instance with explicit parameters: time half-width, ball radius (simplex diameter), Lipschitz constant, and drift bound.

Global existence follows from compactness. Since the simplex is bounded and the drift is bounded on it, solutions cannot escape to infinity in finite time. The `global_ode_exists` theorem chains local solutions forward. Uniqueness follows from Gronwall's inequality in `ode_unique`.

## Stability Theory

An equilibrium $x^\*$ satisfies $F(x^\*) = 0$ and $x^\* \in \text{Simplex}(Q)$. Stability is analyzed through two approaches.

The direct (Lyapunov) approach uses a function $V$ that is nonneg, zero at $x^\*$, and decreasing along trajectories. The theorem `lyapunov_implies_stable` gives stability. A strict Lyapunov function where $V \to 0$ along trajectories gives asymptotic stability via `strict_lyapunov_implies_asymptotic`.

The linearized (Hurwitz) approach examines the Jacobian $J = \partial F / \partial x$ at equilibrium. If all eigenvalues of $J$ have negative real part (the Hurwitz condition), a quadratic Lyapunov function exists. The chain `hurwitz_implies_lyapunov_exists` then `linear_stable_implies_asymptotic` completes the argument.

The Bregman divergence connects these approaches. For a strictly convex generator $f$, $D_f(x, x^\*)$ provides a natural Lyapunov function. The `bregman_lyapunov_data` construction in `BregmanBridge.lean` packages this as a `StrictLyapunovData`.

## The Ising Model

The simplest nontrivial mean-field system has two states: up and down. This is the Ising model, and it exhibits the core phenomenon that drives the consensus module. Below a critical temperature, the population spontaneously magnetizes. Above it, the population remains disordered. This phase transition is the prototype for the gapped/gapless distinction in consensus (Chapter 8).

The state space is `TwoState` with values `up` and `down`. The magnetization order parameter is $m = x_{\text{up}} - x_{\text{down}}$.

The drift function is:

$$\frac{dm}{dt} = \frac{1}{\tau}\left[\tanh(\beta(Jm + h)) - m\right]$$

The parameter $\beta$ is inverse temperature, $J$ is coupling strength, $h$ is external field, and $\tau$ is relaxation time. Equilibria satisfy the self-consistency equation $m = \tanh(\beta(Jm + h))$.

A phase transition occurs at $\beta J = 1$ when $h = 0$. Below the critical point ($\beta J < 1$), the unique equilibrium is $m = 0$ (paramagnetic phase). The proof in `paramagnetic_unique_equilibrium` uses strict sublinearity of $\tanh$: the theorem `Real.tanh_lt_self` shows $\tanh(x) < x$ for $x > 0$.

Above the critical point ($\beta J > 1$), two nonzero equilibria appear (ferromagnetic phase). The proof in `ferromagnetic_bistable` applies the intermediate value theorem to the residual $f(m) = m - \tanh(\beta J m)$, which changes sign on $(0, 1)$.

Glauber dynamics provides the microscopic mechanism: individual spins flip at rates that depend on the local field. The spin-flip rates `glauberAlpha` and `glauberGamma` reproduce the macroscopic Ising drift when aggregated, proved in `glauber_produces_isingDrift`. This is the mean-field reduction in action. Individual stochastic transitions produce deterministic macroscopic flow.
