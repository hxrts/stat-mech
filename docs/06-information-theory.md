# Information Theory and Channels

Every physical system and every distributed protocol faces the same problem: communicating reliably through a noisy medium. A sensor reading corrupted by thermal fluctuations, a message corrupted by a faulty network link, and a vote corrupted by a Byzantine node are all instances of the same mathematical situation. Information theory provides the universal language for reasoning about these problems.

This chapter develops that language for Stat Mech. Entropy measures how much uncertainty a distribution carries. KL divergence measures how different one distribution is from another, connecting to the Bregman divergence from Chapter 3. Channel capacity quantifies how much reliable information can pass through a noisy channel. Error-correcting codes achieve that capacity by creating energy gaps between valid codewords, the same gaps that reappear as fault tolerance thresholds in consensus (Chapter 8).

The key insight is that coding theory is the non-interactive special case of consensus. A code has a single sender and one round of communication. Consensus adds interaction and adaptive adversaries, which tightens the achievable threshold from $1/2$ to $1/3$. But the underlying structure, energy gaps between macrostates, is identical.

## Entropy and KL Divergence

Shannon entropy measures uncertainty in a discrete distribution $p$ over a finite set:

$$H(p) = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i$$

Entropy is nonneg (`shannonEntropy_nonneg`) and zero for deterministic distributions (`shannonEntropy_deterministic`). It is maximized by the uniform distribution.

The KL divergence measures how one distribution $p$ differs from another $q$:

$$D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p \| q) = \sum_i p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i}$$

The Gibbs inequality states $D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p \| q) \geq 0$, proved in `klDivergence_nonneg` using the bound $\log x \leq x - 1$. KL divergence equals zero if and only if $p = q$.

Mutual information $I(X; Y)$ quantifies shared information between two random variables. It decomposes as $I(X; Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)$, where $H(X|Y)$ is conditional entropy. The theorem `condEntropy_le_entropy` shows conditioning cannot increase entropy. Mutual information is symmetric: `mutualInfo_symm`.

## Discrete Memoryless Channels

A channel models any process that corrupts data in transit. The sender picks an input symbol, noise acts on it, and the receiver observes a (possibly different) output symbol.

A discrete memoryless channel (DMC) is a stochastic matrix $W(y|x)$ mapping input symbols to output symbols. The `DMC` structure stores this matrix with the constraint that each row sums to one.

Given an input distribution $p$ and channel $W$, the induced output distribution is $q(y) = \sum_x p(x) W(y|x)$. The joint distribution factorizes as $p(x) W(y|x)$. The theorems `jointDist_marginalFst` and `jointDist_marginalSnd` recover the input and output marginals.

Channel capacity is the maximum mutual information over all input distributions:

$$C = \sup_p I(p; W)$$

Capacity is nonneg (`channelCapacity_nonneg`). It is bounded above by $\log |\mathcal{X}|$ and $\log |\mathcal{Y}|$. The data processing inequality states that post-processing cannot increase mutual information. These bounds are stated as axioms in `Entropy.lean`.

## The Binary Symmetric Channel

The BSC with crossover probability $\varepsilon$ flips each bit independently with probability $\varepsilon$. Its capacity is:

$$C_{\mathrm{BSC}} = 1 - H_2(\varepsilon)$$

where $H_2$ is binary entropy. At $\varepsilon = 0$, capacity is 1 (perfect channel). At $\varepsilon = 1/2$, capacity is 0 (the channel destroys all information). The axioms `bsc_capacity` and `bsc_capacity_half` formalize these.

The BSC is the channel-theoretic model for random bit corruption. In the consensus context, $\varepsilon$ plays the role of the corruption fraction. The zero-capacity point $\varepsilon = 1/2$ corresponds to the impossibility threshold.

## The Coding Bridge

This section makes precise the connection between coding theory and consensus that the introduction previewed. Error-correcting codes are the static (non-interactive) case of the consensus framework. A code of length $N$ encodes messages into codewords. The minimum Hamming distance $d_{\min}$ between distinct codewords determines correction capability.

Unique decoding succeeds when the number of errors $t$ satisfies $2t < d_{\min}$. The theorem `unique_decoding_of_minDistance` in `CodingDistance.lean` formalizes this. Hamming distance instantiates the `EnergyDistance` class, and `energyGap_singleton_eq_dist` shows the energy gap between singleton codeword sets equals their distance.

The repetition code encodes one bit as $N$ identical copies. Majority vote decodes. The theorem `repetition_corrects_up_to` proves correction of up to $\lfloor(N-1)/2\rfloor$ errors. This is the simplest gapped phase: the distance between the two codewords is $N$, creating a macroscopic energy barrier.

## Gaussian Channels and Spatial Capacity

Continuous-valued signals face continuous-valued noise. The Gaussian channel adds noise with variance $\sigma^2$. Its capacity under power constraint $P$ is:

$$C = \frac{1}{2} \log\left(1 + \frac{P}{\sigma^2}\right)$$

Capacity is nonneg for nonneg power (`gaussianCapacity_nonneg`), monotone decreasing in noise variance (`gaussianCapacity_antitone_variance`), and monotone increasing in power (`gaussianCapacity_monotone_power`).

This is where the physics connection becomes concrete. Noise variance and inverse temperature are interchangeable through the mapping $\beta = 1/(2\sigma^2)$. The round-trip identity `noiseToInvTemp_invTempToNoise` confirms this bijection. Higher inverse temperature (lower noise) means higher capacity (`capacity_monotone_invTemp`).

For spatially embedded systems, channel capacity depends on the distance between communicating roles. The `SpatialChannelModel` structure specifies signal power and a distance-dependent noise function. The theorem `spatialCapacity_antitone` shows capacity decreases with distance. Colocated roles achieve maximum capacity (`colocated_max_capacity`).
