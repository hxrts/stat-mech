/-! # Mean-Field Foundations

In mean-field theory, a large population of agents is described not by
individual states but by the fraction of agents in each state. As the
population size N grows, the empirical measure (counts / N) converges to a
point on the probability simplex, and the stochastic dynamics converge to a
deterministic ODE on that simplex.

This file defines `PopulationState` (integer counts over a finite state space),
the empirical measure (normalized fractions), the simplex, and the canonical
two-state type used in Ising-like models with its magnetization order parameter
m = 2x - 1.
