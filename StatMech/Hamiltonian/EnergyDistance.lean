/-! # Energy-Barrier Distance

A pseudometric valued in extended nonneg reals, intended to capture the notion
of an energy barrier between states. In statistical mechanics, transition rates
between configurations scale as exp(-beta * barrier), so a large distance means
an exponentially suppressed transition. The same structure models corruption
budgets in coding theory and adversary balls in consensus.
