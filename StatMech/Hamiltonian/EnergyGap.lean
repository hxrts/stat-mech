/-! # Energy Gap

The energy gap between two sets of states is the infimum of pairwise distances
across the sets. A positive gap means every path from one set to the other must
cross a nontrivial energy barrier. In physics this distinguishes ordered from
disordered phases. In consensus it separates agreement from disagreement
executions, with the gap quantifying finality strength.
