/-! # Transcript distance

The metric on executions that measures how many processes were corrupted.
Two executions are close if they differ on few processes' local traces. This
is the Hamming distance lifted from codeword positions to process identities.

In coding theory, Hamming distance determines the error-correction radius.
Here it plays the same role. If the adversary can corrupt at most `f`
processes, the adversary ball has radius `f` in this metric, and safety holds
when the distance between good and bad macrostates exceeds `f`. The
pseudometric properties (reflexivity, symmetry, triangle inequality) are
proved so this distance plugs into the energy-distance framework from the
Hamiltonian layer.
