/-! # Quorum systems

Quorums are the stabilizing interactions of BFT consensus, analogous to the
coupling constants in a ferromagnet. Any two quorums of size `q` in a system
of `N` processes must overlap in at least `2q - N` members (by inclusion-
exclusion on a finite set). Setting `q = 2f+1` and `N = 3f+1` yields an
overlap of at least `f+1`, strictly more than the adversary's budget `f`.
This honest majority in every intersection is what creates the energy barrier
(gap) between agreement and disagreement macrostates.
