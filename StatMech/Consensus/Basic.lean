/-! # Consensus execution model

The degrees of freedom of a consensus system. A system of `N` processes, each
carrying a local state from some type `S`, evolves through a finite sequence of
global configurations. This is the "microstate space" over which partition
functions, distances, and order parameters are later defined.

Keeping the execution horizon finite (`Fin (T+1)` time steps) ensures all
configuration spaces are `Fintype`, so Boltzmann sums are ordinary finite sums
and no measure theory is needed at this level.
