/-! # Certificates and quorum consistency

A *certificate* is a quorum all of whose members vote for the same value.
When two quorums intersect, any process in the intersection has cast a vote
that appears in both certificates. If each process votes only once, the two
certificates must agree on the value.

This is the mechanism that creates the energy barrier in BFT consensus.
Producing two conflicting certificates requires corrupting every process in
the intersection, which exceeds the adversary's budget when quorums are large
enough. The quorum-size intersection bound from `Quorum.lean` gives the
quantitative threshold.
