/-! # Nakamoto consensus sketch

A Class I (gapless/critical) system. There is no hard energy gap between
competing chain histories, so reorganizations are always thermodynamically
possible. However, the probability of a reorg decays exponentially with
confirmation depth `k`, modelled here as `exp(-c·k)` for a protocol-
dependent rate `c > 0`.

This is "probabilistic finality" in the physics language: `ΔF = 0` but
the system is metastable, with the lifetime of the current consensus
growing exponentially in `k`. More confirmations lower the effective
temperature but never open a true gap.
