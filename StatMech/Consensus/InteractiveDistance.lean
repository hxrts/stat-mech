/-! # Interactive distance between macrostates

The central quantity unifying coding theory and consensus. The *interactive
distance* `Δ_H(M, M')` between two decision macrostates is the minimum
execution-level distance over all pairs of executions realizing those
macrostates. This is the consensus analogue of code distance `d_min`. Just as
a code can correct `t` errors when `d_min > 2t`, a consensus protocol is safe
against `f` corruptions when the interactive distance from good to bad
macrostates exceeds `f`.

When two macrostates overlap (some execution maps to both), the interactive
distance is zero. This is the information-theoretic signature of FLP-style
impossibility: the adversary can push the system from one macrostate to the
other at zero cost.
