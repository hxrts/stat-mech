/-! # Byzantine thresholds from distance conditions

The classic `2f+1` and `3f+1` bounds are not protocol artifacts but phase
boundaries. The `2f+1` threshold comes from static unique decoding: a
repetition code of length `N` corrects `f` errors iff `N > 2f`, i.e.
the code distance exceeds twice the error budget. The `3f+1` threshold
comes from interactive distance: quorum intersection guarantees that
conflicting certificates require corrupting more than `f` processes,
but only when `N ≥ 3f+1`.

The fraction bounds show that these thresholds correspond to corruption
fractions `α < 1/2` (static) and `α < 1/3` (interactive).
